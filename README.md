An R script to modelize a tennis match with Markov chains. The only parameters are the point winning probabilities on serve for a point (2 probabilities : one for p1 and one for p2).
Future work : <\br>
- Imbricate the 3 models to create an Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model
- Adapt the code to various sports
-Create evolving models of Markov Chains (i.e. if the player 1 lsot the first set then he might be less likely to win the second set, hence we could adapt the model depending on the result of the first games)
